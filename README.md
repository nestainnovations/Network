# Network
**Network** - An open source social network app by using peer to peer and through peer technology. It does not require signal or data plan for its normal working!, means it uses Wifi or Bluetooth or other modes for its normal mode of operation.
## How it works?
*Network app* uses the concept of network, peer to peer and through peer for interconnecting its users. At first a user is connected with other user by using their wifi and hence it automatically generates a network name for this connection. a third user using *Network app* will automatically connects with the first network if the device came in range of this network. This third connection is done by using either the generated network name or with the unique user id generated for each user in the *Network app* at its intallation on a device. This unique user id is generated by using the IMEI number of the device. This unique user id is used to identify and send end to end encrypted messages between users (peers). By this way the first person in a network can connect and excahnge text/audio/image/video messages with the last person in the netork even if the last person is not in the wifi range of the first person, this transfer of data is done through other users in the network and this is an secured transfer since the message is end to end encrypted
